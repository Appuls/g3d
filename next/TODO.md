Code Generation Issue: https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/49249

- AttributeExtensions
    - Merging per attribute
        - Test: assert all attributes are covered among indexing and non-indexing + corners per face
    - Inspire from BigG3dWriter

- Merge/Remap VimAttributeCollection
- Object abstractions (instance, shape, mesh, material...)
- code generation for g3d.h (?)
